# 📖 About the Project

Artificial Intelligence is transforming the way humans interact with computers. Traditional writing methods require physical contact with input devices such as keyboards, styluses, or touch screens.

**AI Virtual Writing Board** introduces a completely touchless writing experience by allowing users to write in the air using only their index finger.

Using **MediaPipe Hand Tracking**, the application continuously detects hand landmarks through the webcam and transforms finger movements into smooth digital strokes on a virtual canvas.

The application also integrates **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, enabling handwritten content to be converted into editable digital text. Users can save their work as images or export it as professional PDF documents.

Designed with a clean and modern interface, this project demonstrates the integration of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Web Technologies into an interactive real-time application.

# 🌟 Why This Project?

Unlike traditional whiteboard applications, this project leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to eliminate the need for physical writing devices.

Instead of touching a screen or using a mouse, users simply move their finger in front of the webcam.

The system intelligently tracks the fingertip and converts every movement into digital handwriting.

This project combines multiple modern technologies into one seamless application:

- Computer Vision
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Canvas API
- OCR
- PDF Generation
- Modern Web Development

making it an excellent demonstration project for students, developers, and AI enthusiasts.
